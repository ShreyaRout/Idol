                <p> Dhirubhai Ambani, the legendary Indian business tycoon, had two sons: Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani. 

                    Mukesh Ambani is the older son and is currently the Chairman and largest shareholder of Reliance Industries, a conglomerate with interests in petrochemicals, refining, oil, and gas exploration. Under Mukesh's leadership, Reliance Industries has diversified into telecommunications, retail, and digital services, making it one of the largest and most valuable companies in India. Mukesh Ambani is known for his visionary leadership and strategic acumen in growing the business empire.
                    
                    Anil Ambani is the younger son of Dhirubhai Ambani. He is also a prominent figure in the Indian business world, though his career has taken a somewhat different trajectory from that of his brother. Anil Ambani has been involved in sectors such as telecommunications, power generation, and financial services through companies like Reliance Communications and Reliance Power. However, Anil Ambani faced challenges in recent years due to financial difficulties in some of his businesses, leading to significant restructuring and asset sales.
                    
                    Both Mukesh and Anil Ambani have had significant impacts on the business landscape in India and have inherited their father's entrepreneurial spirit. However, their divergent paths and business approaches have made their individual journeys unique.  </p>

                        <h2>Anil Ambani</h2>
                        Anil Ambani is the younger son of Dhirubhai Ambani, the founder of the Reliance Group. Anil Ambani is an Indian business tycoon who has been involved in various businesses like telecommunications, infrastructure, entertainment, and financial services.

                        Anil Ambani was the chairman of Reliance Communications, a telecommunications company, and the Reliance ADA Group, which had interests in power, infrastructure, and financial services. However, due to financial challenges and debts, Anil Ambani's businesses faced significant difficulties in recent years.
                        
                        As of my last knowledge cutoff in December 2023, Anil Ambani had been dealing with legal battles related to debts owed by his companies. It's advisable to check the latest updates to get the most current information on his business and financial status.
